<h1>The last book</h1>

<details>
  <summary>
   welcome to the last book you will ever need, an evolution of school books
  </summary>

  <p>
and a play on what they should have helped us acomplished yet failed to beyond measure</p>

<p>the books that we wrote in growing up should have been more then books we used to fill out homework they should have been books of knowledge that those that come after us could use </p>

<p>Imagine instead of having to source new textbooks with the most recent advancements in the world, we would go out on an adventure and explore what the world has to offer and documment them in those books </p>


<p>Then those that came after us would build on top of that knowledge and discovered more, book -> textbook </p>


<p>but all we did is instead of think, we copied what was in a textbook and regurgitated the knowledge</p>

<p>today this ends, with this book, a living one, we will be able to take back control and share knowledge that evolves with us</p>

<p>this is the last book<p>
